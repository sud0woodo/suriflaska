DESCRIPTION:
    This is a python script that runs a local flask server. The flask server can be used to test out new Snort / Suricata
    rules. It does this by using an edited suricata configuration which writes its output to a file locally and reads its
    contents after testing the rule.

    The flask server runs the suricata offline replay functionality by executing the following command on the system:

    suricata -c suricata.yaml --runmode autofp -S rules_file.rules -r testPCAP.pcap

    To get the above to work the server takes a PCAP file and tests if the rules
    defined in 'rules_file.rules' match any data present in the packets of the PCAP. The output of suricata is written in 'fast.log'
    as is defined in 'suricata.yaml', this 'fast.log' output (by using the cat command) will be fed back to the flask server and shown
    to the user.

NOTE:
    Do NOT use this in a production environment as I'm fairly certain this is a very insecure flask server!
